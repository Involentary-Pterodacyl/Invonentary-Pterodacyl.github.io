        <h2>About Me</h2>
    </header>     

         <p> I grew up in Cambridge Massachusetts. I am 17 as of the time I made this website and am in my Junior year of High school. I have taken as many computer science courses as I could during high school, but high school is not when the interest began. My love for figuring out how to make computers do things started in elementary school when we where allowed to go to the computer lab once a week to learn how to type. In middle school my interest only grew as I was able to go to MIT's coding for girls weekend program for people my age. I took the opportunity 2 years later in eighth grade to take an additional course through MIT over zoom.</p>

            <p>I had other career ideas throughout the years though. When I was young the plan was to become a goat keeper and sell the milk. As I got more into middle school I considered music. I had been playing flute for a couple years and I wanted to play forever. Then the realization of how successful that was likely to be hit. The last idea before programming was culinary school. 
         That idea ended when I realized not to turn my hobbies into work. Then I landed on programming. So far it's the longest standing idea and I don't mind doing it all day.</p>

                <p> I have other hobbies as well as the ones mentioned previously. Not only do I enjoy cooking but I enjoy Baking. I'm often the one making dessert for holidays. I have also been crocheting for many years. I started by teaching myself how to make dishcloths and have since moved on to making stuffed animals, hand warmers, and a couple other wearable items. I've always been very passionate about my hobbies and work so whatever I make I'm careful to have a pleasant outcome.</p>
