        <p> At this point in my life Ive had quite a few oppertunities to code and do projects but also work and be in that enviorment. I volenteered at a panterary that handed out dipers and other baby nececities from fith grade untill it was shut down when covid started. A lot of my rsponsibilities where gathering and handing out the nessasary items. I also have done some summer jobs. Summer 2023 through my city I worked at a thearte company. In whitch we not only put on a production in 6 weeks but we also looked after some young theare lovers.</p>
        <p> The projects I have worked on have mostly been in school but I put alot into required assighnments. In the 2022 - 2023 school year my AP computer Science final was one I worked on with my class partner to make a short text based simulator. Currently in one of my classes I am coding a remote control car. Also I coded this website. Styling text sizing images and all.</p>
