    <p> I have many skills, a few of which are tangible ones such as any of my hobbies. One of which includes problem solving. Through my time working with code and a small bit of engineering I learned the skill of not only finding the problem but the best way to fix an issue. Which is very helpful when I take on personal projects. It's also useful to have problem solving when working in groups of people. Which group projects are things I have quite enjoyed as long as all the work gets done. In fact I've taken classes where it's built on working with others because it's just a lot of information for one person to manedge. But I don't just have work related skills I also have ample social skills and I enjoy connecting with my peers. I'm very good at taking care of my lovely pets.</p>
